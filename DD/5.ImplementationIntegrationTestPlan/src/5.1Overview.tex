\subsection{Overview}
In the development of CodeKataBattle the choice of a suitable testing strategy is crucial. Given the inherent complexities and distributed nature of microservices, traditional hierarchical testing approaches may prove less effective.

In recognition of these challenges, the testing strategy employed for CKB aligns with the thread strategy. Unlike hierarchical methods, the thread strategy focuses on testing specific threads or pathways through the system, allowing for more granular and targeted assessments. This approach is particularly well-suited for microservices, where a clear hierarchy may be challenging to establish, and interactions between services play a fundamental role in overall system behavior.
