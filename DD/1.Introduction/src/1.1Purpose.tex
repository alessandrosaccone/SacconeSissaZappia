\subsection{Purpose}
The main idea behind the \app platform comes from the term "kata", which is a Japanese word describing detailed patterns of movements repeated many times in order to memorize and master them. This kind of exercise is usually applied in learning karate. \app aims at exporting the same learning process also in the domain of coding and programming. 

The software described in this document involves two main actors, which are students and educators.  Educators can propose code kata battles (or simply battles for brevity), which are problems and teasers to be addressed by coding with a specific programming language,  while students can engage in these battles in order to find solutions to them. Code kata battles are published in the context of tournaments in which students compete with each other.

The main goals of this system are tightly related to the users of the application. On the educator's side, \app allows to easily organize tournaments and coding battles, also for a great number of students. On the student's side, \app creates an enjoyable and playful environment to foster and improve the student's coding skills.
