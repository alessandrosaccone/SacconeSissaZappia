\subsubsection{World and Machine phenomena}
	This section summarizes the previous description into lists of phenomena (events) that occur in the world of interest for the system to be developed. Phenomena have to be interpreted simply as events occurring in the whole domain that is being analyzed in the document, so they have been stripped of any constraint (that will be better specified in the requirements section). 
    \newline Phenomena can be divided into:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{World phenomena}: events happening outside the system and on which the system has no control.
		\item \textbf{Machine phenomena}: events happening internally in the system, independent from the outside world.
		\item \textbf{Shared phenomena}: events that are have an influence on both the system and the world surrounding it. Usually they are further split into two classes:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Machine controlled shared phenomena}: events triggered or initiated by the system with a relevant impact in the domain in which the system works.
			\item \textbf{World controlled shared phenomena}: events initiated by entities of the world that are impactful for the system.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
