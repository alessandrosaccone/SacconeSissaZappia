\subsubsection{Hardware Interfaces}
\app is developed on a server machine that will offer the services described in this document to the users (clients) through a web page.
The server machine requires some fundamental hardware components with their corresponding hardware interfaces:
\begin{itemize}
	\item A processor (CPU): The server hosting the web application needs a capable CPU to handle concurrent user requests and process data.
	\item Main memory (RAM).
	\item Storage (Hard Drive/SSD).
	\item Network Interface Card (NIC): A reliable network interface is essential for communication between the server and users' devices.
\end{itemize}

Moreover, since \app will tightly work with the Internet, the following hardware components will be also needed on the server side:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Internet Connection: either Wi-Fi or Ethernet, a high-speed and reliable connection is needed in order to provide the promised services in an efficient manner.
	\item Firewall and Security Appliances: for security of data over the network.
	\item Load Balancers: for scalability.
\end{itemize}

The end-users (clients) also need some hardware components in order to integrate with the \app environment:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Computer or Device.
	\item Internet connection (Wi-Fi, Ethernet...).
	\item Network Interface Card to manage the connection.
\end{itemize}
