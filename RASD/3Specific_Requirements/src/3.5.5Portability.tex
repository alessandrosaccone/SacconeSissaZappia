The application must be developed as a web application, so it can be used by smartphones, tablets and computers having modern web browser. In other words, the web application should be compatible with any operating system (e.g., Windows, Mac OS, Linux) that supports a web browser. For this reason it could be developed in a common programming language which guarantees the use of a virtual machine employed in the market (e.g. C, C++, C# don't seem to be a good choice; instead Java or Python do)
