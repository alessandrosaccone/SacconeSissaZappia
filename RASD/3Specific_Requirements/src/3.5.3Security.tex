\subsubsection{Security}
As the system stores sensitive personal information about students and educators, security is of great importance. The central database must be fortified with comprehensive security measures to prevent external and internal attacks. Passwords stored in the data store must be encrypted, and in the case of password recovery, clear-text transmission should be avoided. All the channel of communication (e.g. notifications, mails) are assured to be encrypted in relation to the information contained in their messages (e.g. a password recovery is different from a reminder notification). Communication over the internet must utilize encryption to prevent traffic sniffing and spoofing, ensuring privacy and data consistency.
