\subsubsection{Maintainability}
The \app system must uphold a high level of maintainability. Employing appropriate design patterns, adhering to coding standards, and avoiding hard-coding are imperative, so the precision of this document combined with the detailed descriptions of the Design Document are the key for this aspect. The codebase should be well-documented too, and a testing routine must cover at least 70 percent of the entire codebase, excluding interface code.
