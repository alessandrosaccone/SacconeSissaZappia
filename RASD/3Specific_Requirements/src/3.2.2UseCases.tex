        1 - Educator tries to close a tournament before the registration deadline of the tournament passes: \app won't allow the action and reports an error message stating that it is not possible to close a tournament that hasn't even started yet.
        
        2 - Educator tries to close a tournament when some battles are still going on inside the tournament: \app won't allow the educator to close the tournament yet, until all battles are over. At the same time though, \app will no longer let any educator publish battles in that tournament. As soon as all the battles that are still going on are concluded, also the tournament will close automatically.
