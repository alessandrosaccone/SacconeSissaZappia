\subsubsection{Software Interfaces}
The system requires some software interfaces in order to provide its services. Below the most significant ones are reported:
\begin{itemize}
	\item GitHub OAuth interface: the authentication process is delegated to the GitHub platform by means of the OAuth standard.
    \item GitHub API Integration: the system communicates with GitHub's API to allow the creation of GithHub repositories for each battle.
    \item GitHub Actions workflows: \app exposes an API that allows a student of the application to setup the GitHub Actions workflow in such a way that GitHub will send notifications to \app when a new commit is pushed by the student to his/her forked repository.
    \item Client-server interactions occur by means of a HTTPS protocol to exchange data and information.
    \item Database interface: \app needs a database to store and manipulate user's data, therefore a software interface in between \app and the database has to be developed to allow the interaction.
\end{itemize}
