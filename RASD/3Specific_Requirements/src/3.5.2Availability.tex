\subsubsection{Availability}
Given that \textit{Code Battle} is not an emergency service, the system can maintain an availability rate less then 99.9 percent. The average time between a fault occurrence and service recovery (MTTR) should be contained at a maximum of 7 days out of 365 per year. This implies that the service could remain highly available still not being completely reliable.
