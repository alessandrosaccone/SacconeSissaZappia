\subsubsection{User Interface}
This section is dedicated to the illustration of some mockups of the most relevant graphical user interfaces that \app uses to interact with external users (educators and students). 
The aim of these representations is to specify the logical characteristics of the presented interfaces as well as introducing some guidelines on the style and look that the final product will have. This information can be used in order to shape the design of the \app platform in more advanced stages of the development.
