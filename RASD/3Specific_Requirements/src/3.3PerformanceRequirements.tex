\subsection{Performance Requirements}
The \textit{Code Battle} application must deliver efficient performance to meet the demands of students and educators engaging in coding challenges. The system should aim for low latency, ensuring that the time between user interactions and system responses does not exceed a few seconds under normal internet conditions, but it not a strict condition due to the nature of the application. It is acknowledged that users with slower internet connections may experience increased response times due to external factors beyond the system's control. The application should include mechanisms to detect and handle such situations effectively, but it is not mandatory.
